A Gram of Art – Custom GPT Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-02-10

This Privacy Policy explains how the A Gram of Art – Studio Assistant (Custom GPT) handles data when users interact with it. This GPT is created by Soldac Studio to assist with development, documentation, and operations for the A Gram of Art NFC Collection and Smart Advertising system.

1. What data the GPT can access

This GPT only accesses:

Text prompts you provide during conversation

Optional API requests you explicitly trigger (e.g., creating a checkpoint via your backend action)

Public information necessary for technical reasoning (Shopify API docs, Supabase docs, etc.)

It does not have access to:

Your private files

Your device

Your Shopify store credentials

Supabase data

Notion data

Backend logs

Unless you manually provide such data in your messages, the GPT cannot see or retrieve it.

2. What third-party systems are involved

When you ask the GPT to perform an Action (e.g. create a Notion checkpoint), the GPT sends the provided data to:

Your backend server: https://grams-backend-clean.onrender.com

Your backend may then send data to:

Notion API

OpenAI API

This GPT never communicates directly with Notion or Supabase — only through your backend.

3. How data is used

Data you send is used solely to:

Generate responses

Perform actions you explicitly ask for (e.g. summaries, checkpoint creation)

Your backend may store:

Notion checkpoint entries (title, summary, timestamp)

Logs required for debugging or server operation

The GPT does not store or retain any personal data beyond the session context.

4. Data retention

Conversations inside ChatGPT are managed by OpenAI under their policies.

Any checkpoint or documentation you ask the GPT to create will be stored in your Notion workspace, under your control.

Your backend may log limited data for operational reasons.

The GPT itself retains no long-term data.

5. Your rights

Since this GPT does not store personal data itself, deletion requests must be directed to:

OpenAI (for ChatGPT conversation history)

Your Notion workspace

Your backend logs (if applicable)

You can stop using the GPT at any time.

6. Changes to this policy

Soldac Studio may update this privacy policy as features evolve. The latest version will always be available at this published URL.
